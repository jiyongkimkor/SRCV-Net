### SRCV-Net: Self-Refined Cost Volume network

This repository contains the implementation of SRCV-Net and training code. Special thanks to HMSM-Net code from https://github.com/Sheng029/HMSM-Net. The dataset used in our experiment is the track-2 dataset of US3D in 2019 Data Fusion Contest (availiable at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/data-fusion-contest-2019-dfc2019)
